## Overview

{{description}}

## When to Use

- Add the exact request shapes this skill owns.
- Keep the owned surface narrow and singular.
- Include trigger phrases a user might actually say.

## When Not to Use

- Add adjacent tasks that belong to a different skill or to general repo work.
- Reject requests that would broaden this skill into multiple surfaces.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the request matches this skill's single owned surface.
2. Load only the canon, inputs, and local resources required for this task.
3. Do the work using the narrowest reliable approach for this surface.
4. Validate the result before finishing.

## Optimization

- **Inspect:** Inventory the files, state, and evidence belonging to the local
  surface.
- **Compare:** Reconcile the observed surface with its durable local and shared
  contracts, including contradictions, duplication, overloaded artifacts,
  misplaced material, and obsolete state.
- **Recommend:** Preserve aligned state and prioritize only justified
  reconciliation, consolidation, splitting, movement, tightening, or removal.
- **Apply:** After authorization, make the smallest safe local change and
  preserve unrelated state.
- **Verify:** Run the narrowest checks that prove alignment and report remaining
  uncertainty.

## Bundled Resources

- List only the canon files, prompts, scripts, templates, or assets this skill actually needs.
- Keep local resources local unless they clearly pass the hoist test.

## Validation

- List the concrete checks required before returning work.
- Prefer targeted validation that matches the owned surface.
