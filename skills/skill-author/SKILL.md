# Skill Author

## Overview

Author, standardize, optimize, and validate smutlord-local skills using this
workspace's [skill standard](../../references/skill-standard.md), scaffolder,
and validator. The standard owns local conventions and the Tanaab boundary.

## When to Use

- Create a new smutlord-local skill.
- Choose or refine a local skill's type, metadata, folder, or discovery text.
- Standardize or validate an existing `smutlord-*` skill.
- Review whether a local workflow deserves a skill rather than ordinary
  workspace guidance.
- Optimize the local skill collection for overlap, contradiction, or stale
  identity.

## When Not to Use

- Do not author or standardize `tanaab-*` skills; use `tanaab-skill-author` in
  `tanaabased/canon`.
- Do not use this skill for ordinary work that merely happens inside another
  skill.
- Do not force a live skill when the reusable artifact is really a repository
  template or a short workspace rule.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Confirm the proposed skill owns a narrow smutlord-specific surface.
- Preserve useful shared conventions where they still fit, and make every
  smutlord-specific divergence explicit.
- Keep OpenClaw metadata in `SKILL.md` and Codex interface metadata in
  `agents/openai.yaml`.
- Reuse workspace icons from `assets/`; bundle copies only for standalone
  exports. Keep distinct skill-specific artwork with its skill.
- Keep coding-skill documentation, testing, optional deployment, and GitHub
  Actions projection aligned with the local template contract.
- Prefer references and deterministic scripts over repeated doctrine.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not copy a shared Tanaab skill solely to change precedence.
- Do not present smutlord-local structure as global Tanaab canon.
- Do not add broad routing matrices or relationship prose to rescue an
  overloaded skill.
- Do not hoist support files for hypothetical reuse.

## Iteration Loop

- Start with the smallest surface that smutlord should own directly.
- Scaffold or patch the skill, then validate immediately.
- Tighten scope before adding resources, code, or another local skill.
- Recheck the smutlord/Tanaab boundary as either layer evolves, then explicitly
  choose whether to adopt the shared change or retain local divergence.

## Workflow

1. Read the skill standard and confirm the target belongs to its local scope.
2. Read the matching local template when type shape or metadata needs review.
3. Use [`./scripts/init-skill.js`](./scripts/init-skill.js) for a clean scaffold
   or patch an existing skill narrowly.
4. Supply a skill-specific OpenClaw emoji, review whether `Optimization`
   applies to the persistent surface, and decide whether a coding skill has one
   material deployment mechanism worth retaining.
5. Run [`./scripts/validate-skill.js`](./scripts/validate-skill.js), fix every
   error, and review warnings and manual checks explicitly.

## Optimization

- **Inspect:** Inventory local skill ids, owned surfaces, discovery metadata,
  OpenClaw metadata, templates, resources, validation evidence, and their
  relationship to installed `tanaab-*` skills.
- **Compare:** Reconcile local behavior with the smutlord standard and relevant
  shared Canon; distinguish intentional divergence from accidental wrappers,
  duplicated doctrine, unclear precedence, misplaced resources, stale ids, and
  overloaded local owners.
- **Recommend:** Keep justified local behavior; adopt shared changes only when
  they improve the smutlord contract; propose movement to Canon only for proven
  shared capability; and tighten or remove local scope only when evidence
  supports it.
- **Apply:** After authorization, make the smallest local changes and update
  every affected prompt, link, template, validator rule, and consumer.
- **Verify:** Run the local validator for every surviving smutlord skill, search for
  stale identities, and confirm local and shared ownership boundaries are
  explicit.

## Bundled Resources

- [../../references/skill-standard.md](../../references/skill-standard.md):
  independent smutlord-local skill contract
- [./templates/meta.md](./templates/meta.md): local full-template model for meta
  skills; sibling templates define the other supported types
- [./scripts/init-skill.js](./scripts/init-skill.js): deterministic smutlord-local
  skill scaffolder
- [./scripts/validate-skill.js](./scripts/validate-skill.js): smutlord-local skill
  validation entrypoint
- [./lib/skill-author.js](./lib/skill-author.js): local skill definitions and
  command presentation
- [./lib/skill-scaffolder.js](./lib/skill-scaffolder.js): smutlord-local scaffold
  orchestration
- [./lib/skill-validator.js](./lib/skill-validator.js): smutlord-local validation
  orchestration and reporting

## Validation

- Run `bun skills/skill-author/scripts/validate-skill.js --skill-dir <path>`
  from the repository root; fix errors and review warnings and manual checks.
- Confirm local discovery narrows or extends shared capability rather than
  silently replacing it.
- Confirm coding-skill lifecycle sections and their GitHub Actions projection
  follow the local template without duplicated doctrine.
- Confirm retained `Optimization` guidance is surface-specific.
